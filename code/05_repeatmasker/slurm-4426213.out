NAME
    RepeatMasker - Mask repetitive DNA

SYNOPSIS
      RepeatMasker [-options] <seqfiles(s) in fasta format>

DESCRIPTION
    The options are:

    -h(elp)
        Detailed help

    Default settings are for masking all type of repeats in a primate
    sequence.

    -e(ngine) [crossmatch|wublast|abblast|ncbi|rmblast|hmmer]
        Use an alternate search engine to the default. Note: 'ncbi' and
        'rmblast' are both aliases for the rmblastn search engine engine.
        The generic NCBI blastn program is not sensitive enough for use with
        RepeatMasker at this time.

    -pa(rallel) [number]
        The number of sequence batch jobs [50kb minimum] to run in parallel.
        RepeatMasker will fork off this number of parallel jobs, each
        running the search engine specified. For each search engine
        invocation ( where applicable ) a fixed the number of cores/threads
        is used:

          RMBlast     4 cores
          nhmmer      2 cores
          crossmatch  1 core

        To estimate the number of cores a RepeatMasker run will use simply
        multiply the -pa value by the number of cores the particular search
        engine will use.

    -s  Slow search; 0-5% more sensitive, 2-3 times slower than default

    -q  Quick search; 5-10% less sensitive, 2-5 times faster than default

    -qq Rush job; about 10% less sensitive, 4->10 times faster than default
        (quick searches are fine under most circumstances) repeat options

    -nolow
        Does not mask low_complexity DNA or simple repeats

    -noint
        Only masks low complex/simple repeats (no interspersed repeats)

    -norna
        Does not mask small RNA (pseudo) genes

    -alu
        Only masks Alus (and 7SLRNA, SVA and LTR5)(only for primate DNA)

    -div [number]
        Masks only those repeats < x percent diverged from consensus seq

    -lib [filename]
        Allows use of a custom library (e.g. from another species)

    -cutoff [number]
        Sets cutoff score for masking repeats when using -lib (default 225)

    -species <query species>
        Specify the species or clade of the input sequence. The species name
        must be a valid NCBI Taxonomy Database species name and be contained
        in the RepeatMasker repeat database. Some examples are:

          -species human
          -species mouse
          -species rattus
          -species "ciona savignyi"
          -species arabidopsis

        Other commonly used species:

        mammal, carnivore, rodentia, rat, cow, pig, cat, dog, chicken, fugu,
        danio, "ciona intestinalis" drosophila, anopheles, worm, diatoaea,
        artiodactyl, arabidopsis, rice, wheat, and maize

    Contamination options

    -is_only
        Only clips E coli insertion elements out of fasta and .qual files

    -is_clip
        Clips IS elements before analysis (default: IS only reported)

    -no_is
        Skips bacterial insertion element check

    Running options

    -gc [number]
        Use matrices calculated for 'number' percentage background GC level

    -gccalc
        RepeatMasker calculates the GC content even for batch files/small
        seqs

    -frag [number]
        Maximum sequence length masked without fragmenting (default 60000)

    -nocut
        Skips the steps in which repeats are excised

    -noisy
        Prints search engine progress report to screen (defaults to .stderr
        file)

    -nopost
        Do not postprocess the results of the run ( i.e. call ProcessRepeats
        ). NOTE: This options should only be used when ProcessRepeats will
        be run manually on the results.

    output options

    -dir [directory name]
        Writes output to this directory (default is query file directory,
        "-dir ." will write to current directory).

    -a(lignments)
        Writes alignments in .align output file

    -inv
        Alignments are presented in the orientation of the repeat (with
        option -a)

    -lcambig
        Outputs ambiguous DNA transposon fragments using a lower case name.
        All other repeats are listed in upper case. Ambiguous fragments
        match multiple repeat elements and can only be called based on
        flanking repeat information.

    -small
        Returns complete .masked sequence in lower case

    -xsmall
        Returns repetitive regions in lowercase (rest capitals) rather than
        masked

    -x  Returns repetitive regions masked with Xs rather than Ns

    -poly
        Reports simple repeats that may be polymorphic (in file.poly)

    -source
        Includes for each annotation the HSP "evidence". Currently this
        option is only available with the "-html" output format listed
        below.

    -html
        Creates an additional output file in xhtml format.

    -ace
        Creates an additional output file in ACeDB format

    -gff
        Creates an additional Gene Feature Finding format output

    -u  Creates an additional annotation file not processed by
        ProcessRepeats

    -xm Creates an additional output file in cross_match format (for
        parsing)

    -no_id
        Leaves out final column with unique ID for each element (was
        default)

    -e(xcln)
        Calculates repeat densities (in .tbl) excluding runs of >=20 N/Xs in
        the query
